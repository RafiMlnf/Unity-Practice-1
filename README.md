# Unity Practice 1
This first Unity exercise was learned from one of the YouTube channels. Creating a simple game where the player has to avoid randomly looping falling objects from above. The longer the player survives, the higher the score will be.


The assets here are mine (except for the font), and I'm using some of my friends' faces.

Objects are destroyed after passing the specified limit, then they will reappear from the spawn area (top of the screen).
